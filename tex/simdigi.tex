\subsection{Detector Simulation}
%editors: F. Cossutti & M. Casarsa & L. Gray

Event reconstruction studies and the study of some final state observables, such as particle identification, are based on a complete \GEANT simulation of the MTD detector. The sensitive detector simulation is recording the initial time and initial and final positions of energy deposited by crossing particles in LYSO and silicon volumes for BTL and ETL, respectively, integrating them in time intervals of 10 ps. 

This full simulation includes a realistic description of the BTL geometry with crystal bars with their long side orthogonal to the $z$ dimension of the CMS detector. In Fig.~\ref{fig:BTL1} (left) the trays are shown within the Outer Tracker Support Tube, with a radial position of the crystals at 1174.5 mm from the beam axis. The simplified BTL geometry model embedded in the CMSSW framework is based on 48 rows of modules per tray, each including 3 modules of 16$\times$1 crystals of transverse dimensions 57.6 $\times$ 3.15 mm$^2$ with gaps between them corresponding to the space needed by SiPMs. The thickness of the crystals is 3.75, 3 and 2.4~mm, respectively, for each consecutive group of 16 modules moving from the center of the detector towards the endcap region. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BTL1} (right), an aluminum plate with a surface of 92 $\times$ 52.2 mm$^2$ and 3~mm thick is placed below the crystals in front of the tracker volume to simulate the support plate, while a PCB board of equivalent transverse size and 1.6~mm thick is placed 3~mm above the crystals to approximately simulate the readout electronics material budget.

The ETL description is also included in this full simulation but is representative of the geometry described in the MTD Technical Proposal~\cite{Collaboration:2296612}, because of a limitation in the layout software used to build the MTD geometry in \GEANT.
Since either ETL geometry comprises a hermetic double-layer of silicon, the interleaved double-disk design with radially oriented modules from the TP is sufficient to describe the performance of the $x$-$y$ layout design described in this TDR.
Compared to the TP design, as shown in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ETL1}, 11 rings of modules have been used for this simulation in the radial acceptance 324--1291~mm, distributed on two disks placed in front of \HGC (right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ETL1}) at 3038 and 3057~mm respectively from the interaction center. 
The residual difference between the TP and TDR designs lies in the material distribution of the support structures in the ETL.
An approximate description of the support plate is provided by a set of aluminum disks in between the two sensors' disks.
In both designs the total additional material from the ETL is less than 0.2 $X_0$ (radiation length), and the impact of the variations in material is minimal.

For the physics results presented, the DELPHES simulation~\cite{deFavereau:2013fsa} is used to describe backgrounds originated by standard model processes. 
Here the effect of timing information is introduced either by a fast-simulation in DELPHES or by introduction of parameterized efficiencies for signal and background which are then applied to DELPHES reconstructed objects. 
In the fast-simulation, the time of a charged track falling within the acceptance of the MTD is assigned directly from the time of the simulated track at the production vertex, spread by the time resolution at the vertex obtained from full simulation studies of the track reconstruction (Section~5.2.6). 
%This approach is consistent with the one presented in the MTD Technical Proposal. 
In the parametric simulation, the efficiencies are derived from the studies of the event reconstruction based on full simulation. 

The studies developing the case for inclusion of the MTD into the Level-1 trigger, presented in Section~\ref{CSsec:L1trigger}, are performed using two types of simulations.  
For the rates and efficiencies of isolated objects, the fast-simulation technique is used but applied to track-trigger candidates derived from the Phase-2 track-trigger emulator.
This results in time stamps being applied to each found Level-1 track, and emulates the information that would be available in a region-of-interest trigger for the MTD, where each region of interest is a single level-one track.
The Level-1 Trigger simulations pertaining to tagging long lived particles are performed using the full-simulation of the detector, and the corresponding hit digitization in the full reconstruction.

\subsection{BTL simulation}
\label{sec:btlsim}

The task of the BTL simulation is to convert the energy deposits and
the respective arrival times in a crystal into time and energy
measurements that incorporate the response of the detector
and of the readout chain. 
The total amount of energy deposited in each crystal is estimated via
\GEANT simulation by adding all the energy deposits accumulated in the
crystal within an interval of 25~ns from the bunch crossing. 
The signal amplitudes from the SiPMs at the two ends of the crystal
bar are proportional to the deposited energy through the light yield
(LY) of the crystals and the photon detection efficiency of the SiPMs
(PDE), with a signal sharing depending on the longitudinal position of
the energy position within the crystal bar. 
Table~\ref{tab:sim_parameters} lists the default values for these
parameters, tuned on test beam and laboratory measurements discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:design:BTL:TB_results}.   
The numbers of photoelectrons read out by the ``left'' and ``right'' SiPM are
independently fluctuated according to a Poisson distribution. 

The simulation of the detected time of arrival (TOA) at a given BTL
cell includes different effects: the time of arrival of the first
energy deposit in the cell, a time latency for the scintillation light
to reach to SiPM at the crystal ends, and a time-walk effect depending
on the signal amplitude and the signal discrimination threshold of the
readout electronics. The time latencies from the hit position in the
crystal to the left and right SiPMs are parameterized using
test-beam data, which indicate an average light propagation velocity
of about 8.5~ps/mm in the LYSO bars.  
%
The ability of the BTL readout chip (TOFHIR) to provide two time
measurements per readout channel, either both on the leading edge or
on the leading and trailing edges of the signal, is implemented in the
simulation via a set of configurable parameters. The default
configuration uses the lowest leading edge threshold to digitize the
time of arrival, and a time-walk correction using the amplitude
measurement. 
% 

A reference pulse shape of the TOFHIR signal at the input of the
discriminator (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pulse-shapes-CFD}) is used to
calculate the time-walk delay. The pulse shape is based on a detailed
simulation of the TOFHIR chip based on the CADENCE software as
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:BTL_TOFHIR_performance}.  The pulse
amplitude is normalized to the number of photoelectrons 
and the measured time is set by the time when the pulse crosses a
configurable threshold.

Two time measurements are generated for the left and right SiPMs of a
crystal, $t_{L,\,R}$, which are then independently fluctuated with a
Gauss distribution using a global $\sigma$ that includes all the 
contributions to the time resolution summed in quadrature according to
Eq.~\ref{eq:btl_time_res} and Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma_phot}. 
Finally, the charge and time values are converted into integer numbers according to the TOFHIR specifications 
a 10-bit ADC with a dynamic range of 600 pC (corresponding to 15.6 MeV) and a 10-bit TDC with a granularity of 20~ps
(time saturation at 20.46 ns).

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:channel_occupancy} (Section~\ref{BTLSec:Electronics}), the BTL crystal occupancy at 200 pileup events, estimated from this simulation, ranges between 6 and 8\%, for signals of amplitude higher than $E_{\text{thr}} = 1$~MeV (about 25\% of the MIP most probable energy deposition), corresponding to the BTL readout threshold. 
At lower thresholds, the occupancy increases --- about 24\% for a threshold of 100~keV --- because of low energy hits, mostly due to out-of-time interactions originating from back-scattered particles from the ECAL. 
According to simulation, these hits are sufficiently delayed with respect to direct tracks to not pile up on the rising edge of the signal, where the time stamp is obtained. 
Furthermore, the average energy deposits from such particles in the LYSO crystals is typically of the order of 5\% of a MIP signal or less. Therefore, their impact on the amplitude measurement used for time-walk corrections is minimal. 
Dedicated simulation studies demonstrated that the impact of both out-of-time pile up and back-scattered particles on the time resolution is below 8 ps.

The acceptance of the BTL has been estimated from the simulation of single muon events and amounts to about 90\%. This efficiency is defined as the probability of finding a cluster of energy deposits (Section~\ref{C5Sec:mtdreco}) larger than 3~MeV spatially associated to a single muon track. 
As shown in the left-panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:BTL_efficiency_pos}, the inefficiency originates from the $\phi$-periodic gaps between adjacent crystal matrices occupied by the SiPMs (two per tray), the gaps between adjacent trays (36 in each half barrel), and the region taken by the tracker support tube rails at $\phi = 0$ and $\phi = \pi$.  
The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:BTL_efficiency_pos} shows that hadrons suffer from an additional, $p_{\text{T}}$-dependent inefficiency because of nuclear interactions in the tracker material upstream of the BTL.

\subsection{ETL simulation}
%editors: L. Gray & B. Tannenwald

The ETL simulation follows the description of the geometry given in detail within the MTD Technical Proposal. Eleven overlapping concentric rings of silicon modules are used to develop a detector that is hermetic in $\phi$ for the fiducial region of $1.5 < |\eta| < 3.0$. The full simulation of the ETL layout described in Chapter~\ref{Chapter:ETL}, could not be implemented in time for this document. The timing performance is tuned to
% 15\% comes from 30\% in each endcap and then ETL is half the eta coverage of MTD.
be the two-hit resolution of the ETL described in this document, which will lead to about 15\% of tracks in the fiducial area being covered by the MTD having better performance than the detector described previously in this text, which has a marginal positive impact on higher level physics results. Otherwise, the detectors are acceptance equivalent and so the TP geometry can be used to determine the efficacy of the ETL detector with a high degree of accuracy.

In terms of additional material in front of the CE, both the TP and TDR ETL designs use two layers of aluminium to fix the ETL modules in place, and this drives the material budget of the detector. Hence, the differences in material budget between the TP and TDR ETL versions have minimal impact from the perspective of performance of other detectors. 

%FIXME - Plots (in process).

The per-pad occupancy of the ETL depends on the radial distance to the beam line, but is linear with a moderate slope until the last 5~cm of radius from the support cone. It ranges from 0.1\% at the largest radius to a maximum of 2\% at the smallest radius.
% as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{REPLACE}. NO FIGURE ON ECCUPANCY EXISTS IN THE TDR
Simulated hits are digitized and recorded if their energy is larger than 0.1 MIP-equivalents at normal incidence. The timing resolution of the ETL is currently approximated by using the latest beam test results and the expected performance of the ETROC chip, including the statistical improvement from having two measurements on the track for most tracks. This performance is injected into the simulation of the ETL via a single Gaussian smearing of the crossing time of the accumulated energy at the 0.1~MIP threshold that is also used to trigger the recording of the data.
