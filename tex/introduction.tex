\section{Introduction}
This analysis note describe the first implementation in full simulation of the MIP Timing detector (MTD) simulation and reconstruction.

The note starts describing the simulation geometry in~\ref{sec:sim} as implemented for the MTD Technical Design Report. The simulation of the readout electronics, based on design available during the TDR, is described in section~\ref{sec:digi}.

Few key performance aspects are then described in~\ref{sec:acceptance}. Energy deposition, efficiency and occupancy for the 2 compartments of the detector, the Barrel Timing Layer (BTL) and the Endcap Timing Layer (ETL) are discussed in detail for single gun events and minimum bias events.
